# Quantum Seeker Terraform Configurations

Welcome to the Quantum Seeker Terraform repository! This repository contains the Terraform configurations for the Celestial Odyssey spaceship project, an ambitious mission to explore the outer reaches of the Milky Way.

## Overview

The Quantum Seeker is a state-of-the-art spaceship designed for deep space exploration. This repository hosts the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations needed to manage various components of the spaceship, including the powerful XJ-9000 engine.

## Repository Structure

- **aircraft_engine.md**: Defines the configuration for the XJ-9000 engine, including its model, capacity, and security password.
